    <h3>Small Introduction</h3>
    <p> I am from Konaseema, Andhra Pradesh.
        I have learned c and C++ programming Languages, and I got fascinated with python PL and so I went deep into the python language applications,machine learning has attracted all my mind, so I learned the machine learning algorithms and I started exploring how ml can affect the upcoming Technology with the help of AI.
        my field of interest is Machine Learning along with that web designing with those skill sets, I have done a project on the analysis of coronavirus trends and how they spread across the countries, with that analysis, my model can predict the trend of how it going to be in upcoming years.

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Discord chat bot</li>
            <li>Personal/virtual assistant</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It great’s us according to the time like GM, GF, GE.</li>
                <li>And it will welcome us like what about u and says a statement that how can I help you.</li>
                <li>If we need any information and if we ask to get me the information about the particular key terms like a black hole or anything it will search from Wikipedia and reflects us.</li>
                <li>And also, it will perform the tasks like opening the notepad and playing music, and opening command prompts.</li>
                <li>If we say like play the video, it will ask which video u want to play and get the information from us and plays that video on YouTube.</li>
                <li>
                    And if we want to know the facts, It will collect the random facts from the browser and says to us.
                </li>
                <p>While implementing the virtual assistant I used the speech recognition library:  from which my machine gained the ability to listen and identify the words which are spoken by us and convert them into text, to make a query.</p>
                <p>And Selenium library (this is an open-source tool that automates the web browsers and the main application of this library is web testing for robotic framework), from this library I have imported the web driver and I have provided the web browser path from my system which will help my assistant to open the web browser to perform the task which was asked to do.</p>
                <p>
                    I have used the library OS to perform tasks like opening the notepad, command prompt, playing the music, etc.
